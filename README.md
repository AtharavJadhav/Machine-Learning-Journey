# Machine-Learning-Journey

I have set this repository to have a practice as well as document my own Machine Learning Journey. Move to the master branch to view all code.

It has the following parts (Data Pre-processing is included in every subsection, as it is easier to run that way):

* Regression
* Classification
* Clustering
* Association Rule Learning
